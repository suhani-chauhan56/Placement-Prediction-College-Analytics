This project turns raw placement data into a practical analytics product. It combines ETL, SQL analysis, EDA, executive dashboarding, ML prediction, explainability, and decision support in one repo.

---

## 📌 Business Problem
- Which branches are performing best?
- Which recruiters hire the most students?
- Which students need early intervention?
- How do internships and skills affect placement outcomes?
- What is the expected salary for a student profile?

## 📊 Dataset

- **Size:** 12,000 student records
- **Base columns:** `student_id`, `gender`, `age`, `degree`, `branch`, `cgpa`, `backlogs`, `internships`, `certifications`, `coding_skills`
- **Engineered columns:** `communication_skills`, `project_count`, `internship_status`, `certification_status`, `placement_status`, `package_lpa`, `company_name`, `total_skill_score`, `academic_performance_index`, `employability_score`
- **Outcome split:** 10,937 placed / 1,063 not placed

## 📈 Dashboard

The Power BI and Streamlit views focus on executive placement reporting:

- KPI cards for total students, placement rate, average salary, and highest salary
- branch-wise placement breakdown
- gender-wise placement distribution
- company-wise hiring summary
- salary insights by branch and recruiter
- slicers for branch, gender, placement status, and company

The Streamlit app also includes:

- placement prediction
- salary estimation
- student risk score
- explanation panel
- improvement recommendations
- department dashboard

---

## 🗃️ SQL Analysis
- Top 10 companies hiring
- Branch with highest package
- Average CGPA by company
- Students with internship but no placement
- Placement rate by gender
- Package distribution
- Students requiring intervention

### Why SQL matters

- It demonstrates data modeling, joins, grouping, and reporting.
- It supports dashboard refreshes and executive reporting.
- It creates reusable analysis for placement-cell reviews.

### Key Results

**Branch Placement Rate**

| Branch | Total | Placed | Rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Data Science | 1,991 | 1,829 | 91.86% |
| Information Technology | 1,955 | 1,793 | 91.71% |
| Artificial Intelligence | 2,016 | 1,838 | 91.17% |
| Mechanical Engineering | 2,107 | 1,919 | 91.08% |
| Computer Science | 1,950 | 1,772 | 90.87% |
| Electrical Engineering | 1,981 | 1,786 | 90.16% |

**Top Recruiters**

| Company | Hires | Avg Package (LPA) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Infosys | 1,629 | 9.93 |
| Accenture | 1,601 | 9.97 |
| Cognizant | 1,599 | 9.94 |
| Capgemini | 1,558 | 9.92 |
| Adobe | 740 | 13.58 |
| Meta | 751 | 13.56 |
| Amazon | 679 | 13.48 |

## 🤖 Models

**Placement Prediction**

- Target: `placement_status`
- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

**Salary Prediction**

- Target: `package_lpa`
- Algorithms: Linear Regression

### Workflow

- preprocess student inputs
- predict placement probability
- estimate expected salary
- show the output inside the Streamlit app

---

## 🎯 Student Risk Score

- Employability Score
- Placement Risk
- Recommendation
---

## 🧠 SHAP Explainability

The app explains the main factors behind a prediction, such as:

- CGPA `+18%`
- Internship `+15%`
- Communication `+12%`
- Coding `-8%`
- Projects `-10%`
---

## ✅ Results

- Placement prediction and salary prediction are both available in the app.
- The dataset shows a strong relationship between internships, communication, CGPA, and placement outcome.
- Branch and company analytics give the project a real placement-office feel.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Increase internship participation early in the academic year.
- Run communication and mock interview workshops for at-risk students.
- Prioritize DSA and coding practice for weaker branches.
- Track recruiter-wise hiring patterns to improve company targeting.
- Identify students with low CGPA and backlogs before final-year placement season.
- Prioritize departments with declining placement trends.

---

## ⭐ Key Insights

- Students with internships show higher placement rates and stronger salary outcomes.
- Communication scores above 7 correlate strongly with better placement outcomes.
- Product-based companies pay more than mass recruiters, but hire fewer students.
- Certifications add measurable value for students with limited experience.
- Employability score is one of the strongest separators between placed and unplaced students.
