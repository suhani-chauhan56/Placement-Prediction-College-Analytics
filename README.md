Every placement season, colleges sit on a goldmine of data — CGPA, internships, certifications, coding and communication scores — but rarely turn it into a system that actually predicts outcomes.

This project builds an end-to-end **Placement Analytics & Prediction system**: clean the raw student dataset, model it in SQL, explore what actually drives placements, visualize it in Power BI, and predict **placement likelihood** and **expected salary** with machine learning.

---

## 🧾 Executive Summary

> Analyzed **12,000 student records** — academics, skills, and placement outcomes across 6 branches and 13 recruiting companies — to find what drives campus placements, and built classification & regression models to predict **Placement Status** and **Expected Package (LPA)**.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Size:** 12,000 student records, 22 columns
- **Fields:** `student_id`, `gender`, `age`, `degree`, `branch`, `cgpa`, `backlogs`, `internships`, `certifications`, `coding_skills`, `communication_skills`, `project_count`, `placement_status`, `package_lpa`, `company_name`, plus engineered features (`total_skill_score`, `academic_performance_index`, `employability_score`)
- **Outcome split:** 10,937 placed / 1,063 not placed — **91.14%** overall placement rate

---

## 🔍 What This Project Analyzes

**Branch-wise Placement** — comparing placement rates and average packages across AI, CS, DS, Electrical, IT, and Mechanical.

**CGPA & Backlogs vs. Placement** — whether high CGPA alone guarantees placement, or if backlog count is a harder filter.

**Skill Impact** — internship count, certifications, and coding/communication scores against placement rate and package.

**Company Analysis** — top recruiting companies by hire volume and average package, and which companies favor which branches.

**Salary Distribution** — average, top-decile, and highest packages across the dataset.

## 📊 SQL Analysis — Key Results

**Branch Placement Rate**
| Branch | Total | Placed | Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data Science | 1,991 | 1,829 | **91.86%** |
| Information Technology | 1,955 | 1,793 | 91.71% |
| Artificial Intelligence | 2,016 | 1,838 | 91.17% |
| Mechanical Engineering | 2,107 | 1,919 | 91.08% |
| Computer Science | 1,950 | 1,772 | 90.87% |
| Electrical Engineering | 1,981 | 1,786 | 90.16% |

**Top Recruiters**
| Company | Hires | Avg Package (LPA) |
|---|---|---|
| Infosys | 1,629 | 9.93 |
| Accenture | 1,601 | 9.97 |
| Cognizant | 1,599 | 9.94 |
| Capgemini | 1,558 | 9.92 |
| Adobe | 740 | 13.58 |
| Meta | 751 | 13.56 |
| Amazon | 679 | 13.48 |

Mass recruiters hire in volume around ~10 LPA; product-based companies hire far fewer but pay 35–40% more.

**Skill & Score Impact**
- Communication score climbs from ~75% placement rate at score 2 to ~97% at score 10 — a near-linear relationship.
- Avg employability score: **11.12 for placed vs. 8.14 for unplaced** — the clearest separator in the data.
- Top packages (17.2–17.7 LPA) go to CGPA 9.3+ students placed at Adobe, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon.
- Only **76 students** have CGPA > 8 and are still unplaced — a short, specific follow-up list for the placement cell.

## 📊 Dashboard Features (Power BI) 

A single, all-in-one dashboard covering the full placement story:

- KPI cards — Total Students, Placement Rate, Average Salary, Highest Salary, Internship Participation, Average CGPA
- Placement breakdown by branch, gender, and company-wise recruitment
- Student performance view — CGPA distribution, skill impact, communication scores
- Salary insights — salary by branch, company, and CGPA
- Interactive slicers — branch, gender, placement status, company, CGPA range

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models ✅ Completed & Deployed

Both trained models (`placement_model.pkl`, `salary_model.pkl`) are deployed as a live **Streamlit** web app (`app.py`), so predictions run in the browser with no local setup needed.

> 🚀 **Live Demo:** [**Open the Streamlit App →**](https://placement-prediction-college-analytics-j7evnb2vmmmjxmnc6g4fdq.streamlit.app/) Enter student details to get a real-time **Placement Prediction** and **Expected Salary (LPA)** estimate.
>
> ⚠️ *This is a prediction based on historical trends, not a guarantee — real outcomes depend on each company's own hiring criteria.*

**Model 1 — Placement Prediction (Classification)**
- Target: `placement_status`
- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

**Model 2 — Salary Prediction (Regression)**
- Target: `package_lpa`
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor

## 💡 Key Insights

- 🎓 Students with internships show meaningfully higher placement rates and packages than those without.
- 🗣️ Communication scores above ~7 correlate strongly with better placement outcomes (up to 97% placement rate at score 10).
- 💰 Product-based companies (Adobe, Meta, Amazon) pay 35–40% more than mass recruiters, but hire in far smaller numbers.
- 📜 Certifications add measurable salary lift even for students with zero internships.
- 🧠 Employability score is the single strongest separator between placed and unplaced students (11.12 vs. 8.14 avg).
