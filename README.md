Every placement season, colleges sit on a goldmine of data — CGPA, internships, certifications, aptitude scores, communication ratings — but rarely turn it into a system that actually predicts outcomes.

This project builds an end-to-end **Placement Analytics & Prediction system**: clean the raw student dataset, explore what actually drives placements, model it in SQL, visualize it in Power BI, and finally predict **placement likelihood** and **expected salary** using machine learning.

> ⚠️ **Project Status: Partially Complete**
> Data cleaning, EDA, and both ML models (placement prediction + salary prediction) are **done**. SQL analysis and the Power BI dashboard are **in progress**. See checklist below for details.

---

## 🧾 Executive Summary

> Analyzing student academic performance, skills, and internship/certification history to understand what drives campus placements — and building classification & regression models to predict **Placement Status** and **Expected Package (LPA)**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
📄 Raw Student Dataset (5,000–20,000 records)
     │
     ▼
🧹 PYTHON (Pandas) — Data Cleaning
     │   (dedupe, missing values, outliers, encoding, feature engineering)
     ▼
🗃️ SQL (MySQL) — Modeling & Analysis
     │   (normalized tables, department/company/salary queries)
     ▼
📊 POWER BI — Visualization
     │   (KPI cards, 4 dashboards, interactive slicers)
     ▼
🤖 MACHINE LEARNING — Prediction Layer
     │   (Placement classification + Salary regression)
     ▼
💡 INSIGHTS LAYER — Business Decisions
     (skill gaps · department strategy · recruiter targeting)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models ✅ Completed

### Model 1 — Placement Prediction (Classification)
- **Target:** `Placement_Status`
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost (optional)
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
- **Expected Accuracy:** ~85–92% (dataset dependent)

### Model 2 — Salary Prediction (Regression)
- **Target:** `Package_LPA`
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor
- **Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, R² Score

---

## 💡 Key Insights *(to be validated once modeling is complete)*

- 🎓 Students with internships are expected to show significantly higher placement rates.
- 🗣️ Communication scores above a certain threshold may correlate with better placement outcomes.
- 🛠️ Departments with more project-based learning may achieve higher average salaries.
- 📜 Students with multiple certifications tend to receive better salary offers.
- 🧠 Higher aptitude scores often align with placements in product-based companies.
